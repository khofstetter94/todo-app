A Web Application for securely managing a To Do List

The To Do Manager application has the following overall requirements:

- Designed to match the mock-up
  - Header, Main Section Footer
  - Use Mantine for styling and visual components
- The header should present the main menu
  - Home Link, which shows the list of To Do Items
- In the “Main” section
  - The list of items in the to do list
    - Based on user preferences, show listings in groups of (3, 5, etc) and provide the ability to view multiple “pages” of results
    - Each item in list should show the text of the item as well as the assignee
      - Based on user preferences, hide or show completed items
      - If shown, completed items should be styled differently making their status visually obvious
